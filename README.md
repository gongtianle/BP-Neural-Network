# BP-Neural-Network
A C++ implementation of neural network using backpropagation algorithm. I uploaded only the source code.
## Background
I coded this simple implementation with Xcode on OS X and evaluate the algorithm using the iris dataset with cross validation.
The average precision evaluates to 96% on my Mac. Somehow it doesn't evaluate that much on another computer with Windows 10.
