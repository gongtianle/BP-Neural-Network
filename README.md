# BP-Neural-Network
A C++ implementation of neural network using backpropagation algorithm. I uploaded only the source code.
## Background
I coded this simple implementation with Xcode on OS X and evaluate the algorithm using the iris dataset with cross validation.
The average precision evaluates to 96% on my Mac. Somehow it doesn't evaluate that much on another computer with Windows 10. If you know of any reason why this should happen, please do share it with me. You can reach me at lnrdlin@outlook.com
